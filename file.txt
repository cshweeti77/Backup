Read() function retrieves the contents of entire file. However if we want smaller part of file, we can retrieve those in few bytes as::
	f.read(4)  ←- 4 bytes
eg:: f.write(“Python is a fantastic language.”)
	print(f.read(4))
	‘Pyth’



Another way of reading from  a file is reading one line at a time python function readline() is used for this purpose.
	f.readline()
→ ‘Python is a fantastic \n’
readline() function reads a stream of bytes beginning the current position until a new line character is encountered.
	f.seek(line)
	f.readline()
 The function readline() returns the line of text file in the form of a list.
Eg:: I am not good.
        I hate politics.

f.readlines()
[‘I am not good.\n’, 	‘I hate politics.\n’]


function writelines() takes a list of lines to be written in the file as an argument.
S = [‘I am not good.\n’, 	‘I hate politics.\n’]
f.writelines(s)
f.close()
f=open(“textfile.txt”,’r’)
f.read()
--→ output:: ‘I am not good.\n’, 	‘I hate politics.\n’


if we wish to copy the contents of one file to another , it can be done as follows:
	f1 = open(“old.txt”,’r’)
	f2 = open(“new.txt”,’w’)
	f2.write(f1)
